These are some of the accounts I follow and would recommend. as you can see my stuff is very hacker/pentester heavy so that might not be something you care about. 

I think Tanya Jackson of wehackpurple was a developer before doing security. that might be the best of what I follow for your interests. I used to follow more podcasts when I had a long drive but the darknet diaries is all I follow since working from home. 

Since I am not a web dev I won't have much good advice on that. however might want to check out burpsuite and https://portswigger.net/web-security to learn how to use it to check the security of websites. there are other tools as well but burp suite is an industry standard and used by lots of hackers. so that would help you find the flaws. but to fix them youd have to do some research on the flaw.
